# What is this?

As of today (2015-08-21), these files should be the basis of prototypes of the Digital Register View frontend. They should be updated periodically from the real app's frontend. This should allow successfully user researched features to more easily make their way back into the app, and prevent the app's HTML and the prototype's HTML from diverging from each other too much.

The HTML files were saved manually from the current version of the app and named to match endpoint function names in https://github.com/LandRegistry/digital-register-frontend/blob/develop/service/server.py

Absolute paths to static CSS and Javascript were made relative ("/static" was replaced by "./static"). Then some links were fixed manually so that users can click from the initial search page to the search results page, and from there to a title and finally to a title's PDF.

The static directory comes straight from https://github.com/LandRegistry/digital-register-frontend/tree/develop/service/static
