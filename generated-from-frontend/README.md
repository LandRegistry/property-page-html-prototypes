# What is this?

As of today (2015-08-21), these files should be the basis of prototypes of the Digital Register View frontend. They should be updated periodically from the real app's frontend. This should allow successfully user researched features to more easily make their way back into the app, and prevent the app's HTML and the prototype's HTML from diverging from each other too much.

The HTML files were saved manually from the current version of the app but with absolute paths made relative ("/static" was replaced by "./static"). The names of the HTML files match endpoint function names in https://github.com/LandRegistry/digital-register-frontend/blob/develop/service/server.py

The static directory comes straight from https://github.com/LandRegistry/digital-register-frontend/tree/develop/service/static
